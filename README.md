# hello-world
Beginning of something new

Welp, I'm just a dude with a computer science degree looking to BRANCH out my current software dev knowledge. Instead of doing data work my whole life, I'm going to learn how to do Azure! And I guess Node.js, MongoDB, Javascript, Rest API, Python, and a whole bunch of other shit to help accomplish my goals! This is going to be a rigorous time in my life, but I'm totally ready for it.
